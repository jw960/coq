            INSTALLATION PROCEDURE
            ----------------------

WHAT DO YOU NEED ?
==================

   Your OS may already contain Coq under the form of a precompiled
   package or ready-to-compile port. In this case, and if the supplied
   version suits you, follow the usual procedure for your OS to
   install it. E.g.:

   - Debian GNU/Linux derivatives (or Debian GNU/k*BSD or ...):

     aptitude install coq

   - Gentoo GNU/Linux:

     emerge sci-mathematics/coq

   - Fedora GNU/Linux:

     urpmi coq

   - MacPorts for MacOS X

     port install coq

   To compile Coq yourself, you need:

   - OCaml (version >= 4.05.0)
     (available at https://ocaml.org/)
     (This version of Coq has been tested up to OCaml 4.07.0)

   - Either the Dune build system (https://github.com/ocaml/dune) >= 1.6
     or GNU Make version 3.81 or later

   - The Num package, which used to be part of the OCaml standard library,
     if you are using an OCaml version >= 4.06.0

   - Findlib (version >= 1.8.0)
     (available at http://projects.camlcity.org/projects/findlib.html)

   - a C compiler

   - for CoqIDE, the lablgtk development files (version >= 3.0.0),
     and the GTK 3.x libraries including gtksourceview3.

   Note that num and lablgtk should be properly registered with
   findlib/ocamlfind as Coq's makefile will use it to locate the
   libraries during the build.

   Opam (https://opam.ocaml.org/) is recommended to install OCaml and
   the corresponding packages.

   $ opam install num ocamlfind lablgtk conf-gtksourceview

   should get you a reasonable OCaml environment to compile Coq.

   Nix users can also get all the required dependencies by running:

   $ nix-shell

   Advanced users may want to experiment with the OCaml Flambda
   compiler as way to improve the performance of Coq. In order to
   profit from Flambda, a special build of the OCaml compiler that has
   the Flambda optimizer enabled must be installed. For OPAM users,
   this amounts to installing a compiler switch ending in `+flambda`,
   such as `4.07.0+flambda`. For other users, YMMV. Once `ocamlopt
   -config` reports that Flambda is available, some further
   optimization options can be used; see the entry about -flambda-opts
   below for more details.

INSTALLATION PROCEDURE.
=======================

Coq offers the choice of two build systems, a Dune-based one, and a
make-based one. The default and recommended in the Dune based one.

Please see INSTALL.dune.md and INSTALL.make.md for system-specific
instructions.
